# sleepifier.ai
This is the frontEnd for Sleepifier.AI, An app that helps you use your sleep data in order to help you sleep smoother. The overall app was made with [John Zhang](https://github.com/john-zhang-uoft) at New Year NewHack 2021 but has been expanded.

 ## Inspiration
After many nights of poor sleep, our new year’s resolution was to get better sleep. We learned that there are many factors that affect one's sleep but we weren’t sure which factors affect it the most and how much a change in one factor affects the others.

## What it does
Every day in the morning you would enter information related to how you felt your sleep was and some key information about what we did in the day and how your surroundings are, The ai uses this info over many days to find the factors that affect your sleep the most.

## How we built it
We used Flask for the front end connecting to the HTML website. Python is used for processing and TensorFlow is used to create the neural network.

## Challenges we ran into
Flask took a very long time to be properly set. One of our computers could download TensorFlow for some reason

## Accomplishments that we're proud of /  What we learned
I(Simha) learned front end development using python. (John) learned how to create a neural network using TensorFlow and also how to make classes in python

## What's next for Sleepifier
integrate the frontend with the neural network better. test putting it on a heroku website
